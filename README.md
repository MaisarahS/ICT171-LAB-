# ICT171-LAB-

reflection on day 1 - morning :

ubuntu was downloaded on VMware workstation 

made a github repo on github

cloned the github repo onto the VM and ran through whatever was written in the labs

after that, worked on the terminal on both the vm and my mac to see if things are working well and reflected onto the commands written
