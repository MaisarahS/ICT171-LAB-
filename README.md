# ICT171-LAB-

reflection on day 1 - morning :

ubuntu was downloaded on VMware workstation 

made a github repo on github

cloned the github repo onto the VM and ran through whatever was written in the labs 

github repo name ICT171-LAB-

after that, worked on the terminal on both the vm and my mac to see if things are working well and reflected onto the commands written
